# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills and experience as a web developer. The application is built with React and Vite, and it features a clean, modern design.

## Implemented Features

*   **Theme Toggle:** A toggle switch that allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
*   **Navigation:** A responsive navigation bar that provides links to the different sections of the portfolio.
*   **Hero Section:** A hero section with a brief introduction and a call-to-action button.
*   **About Section:** An about section with a more detailed description of my skills and experience.
*   **Projects Section:** A projects section that showcases my recent work.
*   **Contact Section:** A contact section with a form that allows users to get in touch with me.

## UI/UX Redesign Plan

The goal of the redesign is to create a more modern, visually appealing, and user-friendly portfolio. The following is a detailed plan for the redesign:

### Color Palette

*   **Primary:** #6366F1 (Indigo)
*   **Secondary:** #EC4899 (Pink)
*   **Accent:** #F59E0B (Amber)
*   **Background:** #111827 (Gray-900)
*   **Text:** #F3F4F6 (Gray-100)

### Typography

*   **Headings:** "Inter", sans-serif
*   **Body:** "Roboto", sans-serif

### Component Styling

*   **Buttons:** Buttons will have a modern, rounded design with a subtle shadow effect. They will also have a hover effect that changes the background color and adds a subtle glow.
*   **Inputs:** Inputs will have a clean, modern design with a focus on usability. They will have a clear label, a placeholder, and a subtle focus effect.
*   **Textareas:** Textareas will have the same design as inputs, but they will be larger to accommodate more text.

### Layout

*   The layout will be clean and spacious, with a focus on readability and usability. The content will be organized into sections, and each section will have a clear heading.

### Animations & Transitions

*   Subtle animations and transitions will be used to create a more engaging and interactive user experience. For example, the hero section will have a subtle animation that fades in the text and the call-to-action button.

### Accessibility

*   The application will be fully accessible to users with disabilities. This includes providing alternative text for images, using semantic HTML, and ensuring that all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable.

### Mobile Responsiveness

*   The application will be fully responsive on mobile devices. This means that the layout will adapt to different screen sizes, and the content will be easy to read and interact with on a small screen.
